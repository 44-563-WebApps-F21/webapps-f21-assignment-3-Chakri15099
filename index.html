<h4>DEPTH FIRST SEARCH</h4>
<blockquote cite="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/depth-first-search-or-dfs-for-a-graph/">Depth First Traversal (or Search) for a graph is similar to Depth First Traversal of a tree. 
    The only catch here is, unlike trees, graphs may contain cycles, a node may be visited twice.
     To avoid processing a node more than once, use a boolean visited array.

<pre>vector<vector<int>> adj; // graph represented as an adjacency list
    int n; // number of vertices
    
    vector<bool> visited;
    
    void dfs(int v) {
        visited[v] = true;
        for (int u : adj[v]) {
            if (!visited[u])
